## Overview

This project extracts the five most relevant and diverse sections from each PDF collection based on a given persona and job-to-be-done.  
It is **fully offline**, leaderboard-compliant, and runs efficiently on CPU after a one-time model download.

---

## Features

- Semantic section extraction using MiniLM embeddings, TF-IDF, and heading heuristics.
- No file-specific hardcodingâ€”works on any digital PDF collection.
- Fully offline: All models and code run locally, with zero internet at runtime.
- Leaderboard-ready output (JSON format).

## ðŸš© IMPORTANT: Download Models Before Use

Before running the extractor, **download all models locally** with:
```
python download_models.py
```
This will download the MiniLM encoder and Flan-T5-small summarizer into `/models`.

# Step 1: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 2: Download models
python download_models.py

# Step 3: Place input PDFs (e.g., input/Collection 1/PDFs/)
# Step 4: Run extractor
python src/extractor.py

# Step 5: Check output
# Output JSONs will be generated in /output/ (one per collection)
```

---

## Docker Usage

```
# Build Docker image:
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t persona-extractor:latest .

# Run in PowerShell:
docker run --rm -v "${PWD}\input:/app/input" -v "${PWD}\output:/app/output" --network none persona-extractor:latest
```

---

## Output

For each collection, you get a JSON with:
- Metadata (input files, persona, job, timestamp)
- Top 5 extracted sections (file, heading, rank, page)
- Summarized/cleaned section text

---

## Troubleshooting

- If file not found: Check folder spelling and structure.
- If model not found: Re-run `python download_models.py`.
